Robo JS Game
===========================================

This game is made as a direct inspiration from an activity
from my master's class in theory of programming languages.
In the activity, we where tasked to create a script base
on the specified op-codes of the robot.

I though that maybe we can 'game-ify' this by adding levels
as it goes on.
