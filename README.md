Robo JS Game
===========================================

This game is made as a direct inspiration from an activity
from my master's class in theory of programming languages.
In the activity, we where tasked to create a script base
on the specified op-codes of the robot.

The idea is to game-ify this activity by adding levels
and extra functionalities that the original script did not
have.

Shout out to Prof. Solomon See from DLSU for the inspiration for this game (Since the idea popped-in during his class)
